To definitely be able to login using https protocol,
you should first set your authentication credential to the git Remote URI:
git remote set-url

origin https://yourusername@github.com/user/repo.git
Then you'll 
be asked for a
password when trying 
to git push.
In fact, this is on the http authentication format.
You could set a password too:
https://youruser:password@github.com/user/repo.git
You should be aware that if you do this, 

your github password will be stored in plaintext in your .git directory, which is obviously undesirable.
